        I'm passionate about building bridges between people and the things they
        want.

        Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo
        and building
        <a href="https://uwclubs.com" target="_blank">UWClubs</a> to bridge the
        gap between students and community events.

          My personal projects will give you an understanding of what I'm
          interested in much better than anything I could write. They can be

          Before I wrote my first line of code, I was inspired by the graphic
          designs of Malika Favre, Fugs, and LH. These people taught me to see
          the beauty in anything and everything - no matter how small.
          <!-- To see my
        personal works, check out my design archive. I've recently picked up a
        vintage Polaroid from the 80s and have begun documenting my life with it:
        check it out here. -->
        </p>
        <p>
          Further back, before I created my first piece of graphic design, I
          developed a great fondness for the outdoors thanks to my friends at
          Scouts Canada. Not only did they teach me how to kayak, canoe and
          sail, they taught me something fair more important: the value of
          kindness and integrity.
        </p>
        <p>Let's talk about the future, my goal for 2024 is to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Onboard <b>100 communities</b> to a
            <a href="https://uwclubs.com" target="_blank"
              >centralized website</a
            >
            so students can easily find exciting events more easily
          </li>

      <p>Fun Fact:</p>

    <script>
      const firstButton = document.getElementById("firstButton");
      const secondText = document.getElementById("secondText");
      console.log(secondText);

      function showSecond() {
