      <h1 class="title">Welcome! I'm Justin.</h1>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about building bridges between people and the things they
        want.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo
        and building
        <a href="https://uwclubs.com" target="_blank">UWClubs</a> to bridge the
        gap between students and community events.
      </p>
      <h2>What I'm up to</h2>
      <p>
        Professionally I'm a software developer. I'm immensely grateful to have
        worked with my colleagues and proud of the work we've done. To know
        more, check out my <a href="./resume.pdf">Resume</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal projects will give you an understanding of what I'm
        interested in much better than anything I could write. They can be found
        on my
        <a href="https://github.com/jusgu">GitHub</a>.

      <h2>My Past & My Future</h2>
      <p>
        Before I wrote my first line of code, I was inspired by the graphic
        designs of
        <a href="https://www.malikafavre.com" target="_blank">Malika Favre</a>,
        <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawren_Harris" target="_blank"
          >Lawren Harris</a
        >, and
        <a href="https://dribbble.com/Fugstrator" target="_blank"
          >Michael Fugoso</a
        >. These people taught me to see the beauty in anything and
        everything—no matter how small.
        <!-- To see my
        personal works, check out my design archive. I've recently picked up a
        vintage Polaroid from the 80s and have begun documenting my life with it:
        check it out here. -->
      </p>
      <p>
        Further back, before I created my first piece of graphic design, I
        developed a great fondness for the outdoors thanks to my friends at
        Scouts Canada. Not only did they teach me how to kayak, canoe and sail,
        they taught me something far more important: the value of kindness and
        integrity.
      </p>
      <p>Let's talk about the future, my goal for 2024 is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Onboard <b>100 communities</b> to a
          <a href="https://uwclubs.com" target="_blank">centralized website</a>
          so students can easily find exciting events more easily
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        that's it from me—thanks for stopping by.
